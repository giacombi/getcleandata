Wereable computing is a new frontier in reaserch and a huge source for data analysis. The source is UCI Machine Learning Repository. At their [webpage][link] there are basic informations about the source of data and the materials and method along with explanations of the variables involved. 

The codebook `Codebook.md` contains all the narrative and code explanation, from data downloading to tidy dataset. 

The entire source script is `run_analysis.R` and provides as output a tidy dataset in the format of a text file `tidy_dataset.txt` in the `/Data` directory.
